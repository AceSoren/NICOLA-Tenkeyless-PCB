# NICOLA-Tenkeyless-PCB
Personal NICOLA compliant PCB design I want to print out.

<p>
The gist of it:<br>
The NICOLA Thumb-Shift design is a variation of Fujitsu's original that takes into account the fact that USB HID did not allow cross thumb-shifts. Fujitsu originally designed the Thumb-Shift layout, but the rights were transferred to the Japan Input Consortium and was adjusted from there. NICOLA is short for "Nihongo Nyuryoku Consortium Layout", and maintains the principles that made Fujitsu's layout so good, while accounting for hardware shortcomings.<br>
In short: The goal here is to make a NICOLA compliant Tenkeyless keyboard, preferably compliant with QMK.
